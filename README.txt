This file is split into two sections. Both run off of the same three reactions.py, ball.py and simulation.py files. However, by running them in different ways they can be used for both the Ideal Gas Laws section, and for the chemical reactions which have been programmed.
All included .py files have been listed below.

Visualization.
For best visualization of the ideal gas program, run ideal_gas_visualize.py. 
For best visualization of the chemical reactions, run reactions_visualise.py.

Data Collection.
An example file which can be used to collect data for both sections is included. These will not record large data sets but will show how the data is collected. 
For example data collection of both the ideal gasses run collect.py
This file will save data to the example_data folder.

Data Analysis.
The following files which were used for data analysis are listed below and are kept in the data_analysis folder. 
These files run using the stored data as mentioned below.
plot_number.py , plot_temp.py, plot_volume.py and maxwell_plot.py plot the graphs for the Ideal Gas section.

alpha_fit.py  and exponential_fit.py plot the graphs for the chemical reactions.

Stored Data.
All txt files from the simulations are stored in the data folder. 
Within Data, there should be 5 folders, K_E, Number, Reactions_data_1, Reactions_data_2, and Volume.
